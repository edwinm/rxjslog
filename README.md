# rxjslog

Log RxJS events nicely to the console.

RxJSLog works in both the browser as in Node.js environments.

## Install

```sh
npm install rxjslog
```


## Example code

```javascript
import {log} from "rxjslog";

const obsComplete = interval(500).pipe(take(3));

obsComplete.pipe(log("obsComplete"));

obsComplete.subscribe();
```

## Configuration

You can configure the icons and colors used.

For the `next`, `error` and complete `complete` log messages,
you can set the `icon` and `color`.

To stay compatible with Node.js log messages, use only one of these colors:
black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white.

Example:
```
import {logConfig} from "rxjslog";

logConfig({ error: { icon: "‚ùó", color: "red" } });
```
